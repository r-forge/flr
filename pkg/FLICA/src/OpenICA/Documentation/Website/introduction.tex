The \htmladdnormallink{Integrated Catch at Age (ICA)}{http://www.ices.dk/committe/acom/wg/asoft/ICA/Doc/ICMANUAL.html} analysis was written by K. Patterson to provide an analytical stock assessment tool which allows a variety of model choices to be implemented conviniently \citep{pat96a}. This Fortran program is extensively used in Europe to assess the status of pelagic stock.

%The present Open Source version of ICA was developed in order to incorporate it into \htmladdnormallink{FLR}{http://www.flr-project.org/}. For this purpose, calls to the \htmladdnormallink{NAG}{http://www.nag.co.uk} library were replaced by subroutines available in the \htmladdnormallink{CERN}{http://www.cern.ch/cernlib} library.x

In order to include ICA into the Fishery Library in R, a group of scientists (M. Kienzle, L. Kell) decided to replace the call to the NAG library with calls to a public domain library. They chose \htmladdnormallink{cernlib}{http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/} for the quality of software they provided, in particular for \htmladdnormallink{MINUIT}{http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/minuit/minmain.html}, a set of functions for minimization and error analysis.
