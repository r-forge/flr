The purpose of this directory is to test the version of ICA it contains.

Test against simulated datasets
-------------------------------

The version of ICA in this directory was tested against simulated dataset generated by M. Kienzle and J. Simmonds which description and usage can be found in the following document: Simulating the dynamic of a fishery to discriminate between different stock assessment options: application to the North East Atlantic mackerl, ICES, CM 2004/ACFM:08. The version of ICA (compiled on Windows) used for this work was found to estimate perfectly all parameters used to simulate the population dynamic of the mackerel stock.

100 datasets were simulated assuming that a yearly survey provided an absolute measure of the abundance of the stock, it is without variability or bias, landings were also assumed to be un-biased. 

How to fit ICA to all simulated datasets
----------------------------------------

The following command helped to fit ICA automatically against a large number of dataset in vayu, which shell is tcsh.

module load nag
set path = ( $path /home/599/mak599/Fortran/ICA/ICA_NAG_Mark22 )

cd /home/599/mak599/Fortran/ICA/ICA_NAG_Mark22/Data/Simulated/Absolute-NoVariability-NoSSBbias-NoCatchBias-SSBsurveyNVNVNV
foreach i (`seq 1 100`)
cd /home/599/mak599/Fortran/ICA/ICA_NAG_Mark22/Data/Simulated/Absolute-NoVariability-NoSSBbias-NoCatchBias-SSBsurveyNVNVNV/$i;
ICA.exe < ICAsettings.txt
end

How to produce graphical summaries comparing results from different source
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Comparing a version of ICA to parameter used to simulate datasets
	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	A PERL script was written to gather parameter estimates generated by a version of ICA which results are ouput in the same directory as the simulated dataset. You have to be careful that you run the version of ICA you wish against these dataset before you compare its results to parameters used in simulation.
