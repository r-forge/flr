
Modifications to ICA and ICP after April 1998

August 1998:

(1)  New variable 'UpdatePopulations' added to 'INDAT.INC' common block.
This is used to speed up the Bayes MCMC calculations. When a consditional
probability calculation does NOT need the Ns and Fs to be recalcualted
(e.g. when sampling catchabilities or variances) then the variable is
used to switch off the cohort calculations.

Change affects: MC.F90
                OBJECT.F90
                INDAT.INC


(2) Error found in passing parameters from ICA to ICP in thecase that there
is one SSB index but no age-structured index. If this happens the programme
loses the QBparm parameter which flags the catchability model type

Correction made to      WBLK.F90
                        ReadBLK.F90
