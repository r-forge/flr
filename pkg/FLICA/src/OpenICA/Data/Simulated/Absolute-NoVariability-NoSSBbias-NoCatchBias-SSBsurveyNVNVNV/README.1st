This simulation setup are:
 - number of iteration is 100
 - F varies between 0.15 and 0.3 according to a uniform distribution 
 - M is constant, fixed to 0.15 
 - the recruitment is re-sampled from the last ICA (2003) stock assessment estimations
 - the gear selectivity is fixed throught time at an ad hoc value
 - SSB varies randomly around the simulated value with SD taken from D. Beare's simulations ? FALSE
 - Added variability to the fishing mortality via var/cov matrix ? FALSE
 - Is the variable fishing mortality applied only to the catch (measurement error) ? FALSE
