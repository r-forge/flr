		CHANGES IN FLCore VERSION 3.0

NEW FEATURES
	- [<- FLArray now accepts an input FLQuant and keeps the structure, still recyling
	  as appropriate.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
  - model.frame(FLComp) now has an mcf=TRUE argument to correct slots of different dim
  - computeLogLik method added to FLModel. Will return a logLik object calculated with
    the data and params in the object
  - New iterMedians(FLQuant) method to applky median along iter dim
  - coerce method for data.frame to FLPar now assumes a 2D structure with iters as rows
    and params as columns
  - rlnorm(FLPar, ...) and rnorm(FLPar, ...) now available
  - mvrnorm(numeric, FLQuant) and mvrnorm(numeric, FLQuant, matrix) now available
	- propagate(FLComp) now propagates FLPar slots as well
	- added FLPars class

BUG FIXES
  - iterMeans(FLQuant) was not operating along the 6th dim
	- coerce from FLPar to data.frame now works as expected
