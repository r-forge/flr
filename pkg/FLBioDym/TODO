ADD

- diagnostics
- vcov & hessian are arrays make them FLPar objects  
- sort out 1 & n iters and add validation
- jacknife and to work with iters
- admbBD to work with iters
- Using foreach and multicore/OpenMPI
- Kobe methods for producing probabilities etc. (FLQuant/FLPar needs to be fixed) 
- Alternative Stock Production functions, e.g. fox, ...
- ADMB-RE to implement Randon effects to allow modelling of process error
- FLIndexPMs, alternative likelihood formualtions & more than i index
- iters for @bounds
- iter checking "1 or n" depends on what is being done! i.e. fitting, projection or MSE
- multiple stocks for Robin Hood assessments
- McMC
- Backwards projection to estimate std of BMSY
- make admb methods generic and reusable, i.e. currentkly admb methods are specific to FLBioDym
- DLL interface

BUGS
----
2.14 replace fwd with C++ code
2.15 replace stock slot with a method

21.10.2011 - Operators with iters
  bd=simFLBioDym()
  class(stock(bd)/bmsy(bd))
  params(bd)=propagate(params(bd),10)
  stock(bd)/bmsy(bd)
  stock(bd)=propagate(stock(bd),10)

- window(bdTrue, start=20)
  stock(bd)/bmsy(bd)

̣
- bd=simFLBioDym()
- sp(), messes up iters in params & FLquants

- bounds(object)<- etc not working
DONE
----

- fwd to work with iters
- ̣Add process error in projections
- FLBioDyms
- plot(FLBioDyms)

20.10.2011 - To add a TODO file
