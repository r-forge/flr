\usage{
FLSAM(stck, tun, ctrl, run.dir=tempdir(), batch.mode=FALSE)

\arguments{
  \item{stck}{\code{\link[FLCore]{FLStock}} object containing all data to be used in the assessment
}

}
  \item{ctrl}{\code{\link{FLSAM.control}} object containing the parameters to be employed in the assessment

\details{
FLSAM is an FLR wrapper to SAM, the state-space assessment model. SAM is written in the compiled ADMB language - compiled executables for each platform are included within the FLSAM package. The FLSAM function provides the interface between the data (\code{\link[FLCore]{FLStock}}, \code{\link[FLCore]{FLIndices}} objects) and configuration objects (\code{\link{FLSAM.control}}) stored in R, and the compiled exectable. 

Three helper functions provide the core of the FLSAM method. FLR2SAM accepts the necessary data objects and writes a series of text files to the path specified by run.dir. runSAM takes care of running the SAM executable and checking that the model has run to completion correctly. SAM2FLR reads the outputs generated by the SAM model and reads them back into the FLR environment. The FLSAM function provides a wrapper around these three functions, writing the data to the temporary directory, running the executable, and reading the results back. Generally, the user should not need to use FLR2SAM, runSAM or SAM2FLR, but they can be useful in helping to debug the code. 

The user can also specify the directory (via the 'run.dir' argument) in which the temporary files used to communication with SAM are stored. The default is to use the temporary directory of R.

FLSAM can also be run in "batch-mode" through the 'batch.mode' argument. This is a particularly useful feature when running a large number of assessment in an unattended situation. If the SAM model fails to converge in when running in batch-mode, it will suppress the error and return a "NULL" value (instead of an FLSAM object). If the model fails to converge when not running in batch-mode (the default), an error is returned.

\value{
The typical return value is an object of the FLSAM class with the following slots.
\item{control}{The \code{\link{FLSAM.control}} object used to configure the assessment.}
\item{nopar}{The number of parameters fitted by the model}
\item{nlogl}{The negative log-likelihood of the fitted parameters}
\item{vcov}{The variance-covariance matrix of the fitted parameters}
\item{params}{The parameters fitted by the model, stored as a data.frame. The columns of the data frame are \itemize{
\item index - A numeric index for the parameter
\item name - The name of parameter
\item value The fitted value of the parameter
\item std.dev -The standard deviation of the fitted value}}
\item{stock.n}{An \code{\link[FLCore]{FLQuant}} object containing the stock-numbers at age in each year }
\item{harvest}{An \code{\link[FLCore]{FLQuant}} object containing the fishing mortality at age in each year }
\item{residuals}{A data.frame summarising the observed and fitted values, and the residuals linking them. The columns of the data frame are \itemize{
\item year - the year in which the observation was made
\item fleet - the fleet the observation corresponds to
\item age - the age the observation corresponds to. For biomass indices, this value has no meaning 
\item log.obs - the natural logarithm of the observed value
\item log.mdl - the natural logarithm of the modelled value
\item std.res - the standardised residual i.e. (log.obs - log.mdl) / obs.std, where obs.std is the observation error associated with that fleet/age.}}
\item{name}{A text field giving the name of the object}
\item{desc}{A text field describing the object}
\item{range}{A named vector containg key information about range covered by the object \itemize{
\item min - the youngest age modelled
\item max - the oldest age modelled (can be a plus group)
\item plusgroup - the agegroup considered as a plusgroup (if any)
\item minyear - the first year modelled
\item maxyear - the last year modelled
\item minfbar - the younger limit of ages used in calcualting the average fishing mortality, fbar
\item maxfbar - the older limit of ages used in calcualting the average fishing mortality, fbar
}}
\item{info}{Contains key information about the software versions and operating system used in running the assessment}
The FLSAM function will return an FLSAM object in all cases when the model converges. If the model does not converge, FLSAM will return an error unless it is running in batch mode, in which case it will return "NULL".

runSAM() returns an integer error code corresponding to the return value of the SAM model - 0 for a successful run, non-zero otherwise. SAM2FLR will return an FLSAM object. FLR2SAM does not return any values.
