FLSAM ChangeLog

<Date in future> v 0.32
 * Incorporated new version of SUSAM diagnostics, with a smoother on the
   Tukey-Anscombe plot

2011-11-01 v 0.31
 * Implemented changes by Morten Vinther to account for year-ahead indices
 * Fixed problem with run.dir argument to FLSAM being wrongly named!

2011-10-27 v 0.30
 * Replaced ADMB template and executables. Previous versions used the ADMB tpl
   file called "ssass.tpl". This was a development version that dates from
   somewhere around about mid-2010 or so, when SAM was first setup for North
   Sea herring. SAM has recently been moved into a formal version control
   system (SVN) and the version used here, revision 4, therefore represents
   the newest vesion available.

2011-10-26 v 0.20-2
  * Added residual.diagnostics() function
