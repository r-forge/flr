 * Fixed bug in FLR2SAM that was not writing obs.dat correctly for SSB indices
 * Redefined accessor functions for ssb, tsb, rec, fbar to return a data frame
   rather than the previous FLQuant objects. Added n, f, and catch accessors. 
 * Added looi() function for doing leave-one-in/leave-one-out runs, and a
   retro function for doing retrospective runs (Issues 16 and 28)
 * All accessor functions methods are overloaded for both FLSAM and FLSAMs objects.
 * Standardised return format of accessor functions, including output of CVs
 * power.law.exps() accessor function added
 * Catchabilities, obs.var and power.law.exps accessor functions now return
   parameters for SSB indices in addition to number-at-age indices. (Issue
   12). Methods also overloaded for FLSAMs objects

2011-11-01 v 0.31
 * Implemented changes by Morten Vinther to account for year-ahead indices
 * Fixed problem with run.dir argument to FLSAM being wrongly named!

2011-10-27 v 0.30
 * Replaced ADMB template and executables. Previous versions used the ADMB tpl
   file called "ssass.tpl". This was a development version that dates from
   somewhere around about mid-2010 or so, when SAM was first setup for North
   Sea herring. SAM has recently been moved into a formal version control
   system (SVN) and the version used here, revision 4, therefore represents
   the newest vesion available.

2011-10-26 v 0.20-2
  * Added residual.diagnostics() function
